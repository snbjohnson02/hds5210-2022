# Feedback on Final

Your work was easy to follow and clearly laid out.  There were several requirements of the final missed, however.
1. I didn't see any evidence of you merge together you datasets using a join, concat, or merge.
2. The project required use of functions to abstract or encapsulate logic.  I didn't see any use of functions.
