* _Correctness    (out of 40):_ 39
* _Good Practices (out of 10):_ 10
* _Docs / Testing (out of 10):_ 2

_Details on the grading criteria for the midterm can be found on [Canvas](https://canvas.slu.edu/courses/28045/rubrics/23671)._

You're missing the required docstrings and tests throughout the midterm, but you did have some good comments. I've deducted 8 points from _Docs / Testing_ for that.

It would have been nice if you'd removed all of your debugging `print` statments before submitting.

## Step 1
* Nice work. No additional comments.
* You should not use the `&` operator here when you mean to do a logical `and`.

## Step 2
* No additional comments.

## Step 3
* The weekday() function returns 0 for Mondays. You used a test against `1` in your code. I've deducted 1 point from _Correctness_ for that.

## Step 4
* Good work. No additional comments.
